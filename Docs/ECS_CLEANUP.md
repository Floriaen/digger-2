## Introduction

This document outlines a critical cleanup phase to eliminate architectural inconsistencies introduced during the initial ECS (Entity-Component System) refactor. The codebase currently contains a **mix of object-oriented and ECS patterns**, leading to confusion, duplication, and bugs.

### Current Problems

1. **Inconsistent Physics**: Player uses custom falling logic while rocks use FallableComponent
2. **Legacy Entity Files**: `src/entities/chest.js` and `src/entities/protective-block.js` still exist despite having BlockFactory
3. **Legacy Block Registry**: `src/terrain/block-registry.js` contains pre-ECS functions (`isSolid()`, `isTraversable()`, `BLOCK_TYPES`)
4. **Poor Component Naming**: `LavaComponent` is too specific - should be `LethalComponent` (reusable for spikes, poison, etc.)
5. **Code Duplication**: `DigIndicatorComponent` and `HUDComponent` have duplicate indicator rendering logic
6. **Missing System**: FallingBlocksComponent was deleted but falling block physics logic was never integrated into a proper system

### ECS Architecture Principles (RULES)

**Golden Rule**: ALL game objects MUST be composed of components. NO standalone entity classes outside the factory pattern.

#### Component Guidelines

1. **Components contain BOTH data AND behavior**
   - BAD: Component with only properties, logic elsewhere
   - GOOD: Component with properties + methods that operate on those properties

2. **Components are self-contained**
   - A component should not directly manipulate other components
   - Use component methods, not direct property access from outside

3. **Use generic, reusable component names**
   - BAD: `LavaComponent` (too specific)
   - GOOD: `LethalComponent` (reusable for any deadly block)

4. **One component, one responsibility**
   - PhysicsComponent: collision only
   - HealthComponent: HP tracking only
   - DiggableComponent: digging behavior only

#### System Guidelines

1. **Systems orchestrate component interactions**
   - Systems find entities with specific components
   - Systems call component methods (not inline logic)
   - Systems handle cross-entity behavior (e.g., falling blocks hitting player)

2. **Systems should be in `src/systems/`**
   - NOT in `src/components/` if they manage multiple entities

#### Factory Guidelines

1. **BlockFactory is the ONLY way to create Block entities**
   - NO standalone entity classes
   - NO inline `new Block([...])` calls outside factory
   - Factory methods compose components to create block types

2. **Factory methods should be descriptive**
   - `BlockFactory.createMud(hp, variant)`
   - `BlockFactory.createChest(loot)`
   - `BlockFactory.createLethalBlock(spriteX, spriteY)` (for lava, spikes, etc.)

## Cleanup Plan (REVISED 2025-10-06)

### Phase 0: Resolve Component Base Class Conflict ✅ COMPLETE (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Audit and unify the two conflicting Component base classes

**Resolution**:
- Both component types serve **different architectural purposes**:
  - `lifecycle-component.js` (LifecycleComponent): Game loop components (player, camera, terrain, HUD)
  - `component.js` (Component): ECS block components (pure data containers)

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Audited all files importing `component.base.js` (11 files)
2. ✅ Audited all files importing `component.js` (8 block components)
3. ✅ Renamed `component.base.js` → `lifecycle-component.js`
4. ✅ Renamed class `Component` → `LifecycleComponent`
5. ✅ Updated all 11 game loop component imports and class declarations

**Validation**:
- [x] Two distinct component types with clear naming
- [x] All components inherit from appropriate base
- [x] No import conflicts

---

### Phase 1: Remove Legacy Files ✅ COMPLETE (Priority: Critical)

**Goal**: Delete all pre-ECS artifact files

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Deleted `src/entities/chest.js`
2. ✅ Deleted `src/entities/protective-block.js`
3. ✅ Deleted `src/terrain/block-registry.js`
4. ✅ Removed all BLOCK_TYPES, isDiggable(), isTraversable() imports
5. ✅ Replaced with ECS component checks (.has(), .get())

**Validation**:
- [x] `src/entities/` only contains block.entity.js
- [x] No BLOCK_TYPES references in game code
- [x] All block checks use ECS components

---

### Phase 2: Rename LavaComponent → LethalComponent ✅ COMPLETE (Priority: High)

**Goal**: Use generic naming for reusable components

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Renamed `src/components/blocks/lava.component.js` → `lethal.component.js`
2. ✅ Renamed class `LavaComponent` → `LethalComponent`
3. ✅ Updated all imports across codebase
4. ✅ Updated `BlockFactory.createLava()` to use LethalComponent
5. ✅ Updated player.component.js death checks
6. ✅ Updated terrain-generator.js and tile-renderer.js

**Files Updated**:
- `src/components/blocks/lethal.component.js` (renamed)
- `src/factories/block.factory.js`
- `src/components/player.component.js`
- `src/terrain/terrain-generator.js`
- `src/rendering/tile-renderer.js`
- `src/components/terrain.component.js`

**Validation**:
- [x] All references use LethalComponent
- [x] lethal.component.js exists and is documented
- [x] Generic naming allows reuse for spikes, poison, etc.

---

### Phase 3: Fix DigIndicatorComponent BLOCK_TYPES Usage ✅ COMPLETE (Priority: High)

**Goal**: Replace legacy block-registry check with component checks

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✅ Updated `src/components/dig-indicator.component.js`
2. ✅ Replaced BLOCK_TYPES.EMPTY check with PhysicsComponent check
3. ✅ Removed block-registry import
4. ✅ Added PhysicsComponent import
5. ✅ Now uses `block.get(PhysicsComponent).isCollidable()`

**Validation**:
- [x] DigIndicatorComponent uses ECS component checks
- [x] No block-registry imports
- [x] Outline rendering works correctly

---

### Phase 4: SKIP (Confirmed Unnecessary)

**Reason**: No meaningful code duplication between DigIndicatorComponent and HUDComponent

---

### Phase 5: Audit and Document ✅ COMPLETE (Priority: High)

**Goal**: Ensure codebase is fully ECS-compliant and documented

**Completed Tasks**:

#### 5.1: Code Audit
1. ✅ Searched for `new Block()` calls - only in BlockFactory (correct)
2. ✅ Verified all ECS component checks use `.has()` and `.get()` methods
3. ✅ Confirmed all blocks created via BlockFactory
4. ✅ No block-registry imports in game code

#### 5.2: Update Documentation
1. ✅ Updated `ECS_CLEANUP.md` with completion status
2. ⚠️ COMPONENTS.md and SYSTEMS.md deferred (low priority)

#### 5.3: Code Comments
1. ✅ All block components have JSDoc
2. ✅ BlockFactory has comprehensive JSDoc
3. ✅ LifecycleComponent base class documented

**Validation**:
- [x] No architectural violations
- [x] All legacy files removed
- [x] ECS patterns consistently applied
- [x] Cleanup plan updated with results

---

### Phase 6: Player Gravity Unification ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Player and rocks use the same gravity component via unified system

**ECS Architecture Principle**:
In proper ECS, gravity should be a **shared component** (composition), NOT inheritance.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Inheritance (anti-pattern in ECS)
class PhysicsEntity extends BaseEntity {
  applyGravity() { ... }
}
class Player extends PhysicsEntity { ... }

// ✅ CORRECT: Composition (ECS pattern)
const player = new Entity([
  new FallableComponent({ velocityY: 0, gravity: 0.5 }),
  new PositionComponent(),
  ...
]);

const rock = new Entity([
  new FallableComponent({ velocityY: 0, gravity: 0.5 }),
  new PhysicsComponent(),
  ...
]);

// System handles ALL entities with FallableComponent
class GravitySystem {
  update(entities) {
    entities
      .filter(e => e.has(FallableComponent))
      .forEach(entity => {
        const fallable = entity.get(FallableComponent);
        fallable.tick(deltaTime);
      });
  }
}
```

**Completed Tasks**:

#### 6.1: Create GravitySystem ✅
1. ✅ Created `src/systems/gravity.system.js`
2. ✅ System manages all falling blocks with `FallableComponent`
3. ✅ Calls `fallable.tick(deltaTime)` for each falling entity
4. ✅ Handles ground collision and `land()` / `reset()`
5. ✅ Detects falling block → player collision (death)

#### 6.2: Refactor PlayerComponent ✅
1. ✅ Added `FallableComponent` instance to player (`this.fallable = new FallableComponent()`)
2. ✅ Removed custom property: `this.velocityY`
3. ✅ Updated player falling logic to delegate to `FallableComponent`
4. ✅ Uses `fallable.start()` / `fallable.tick()` / `fallable.velocityY`

#### 6.3: Update FallableComponent ✅
1. ✅ Component already handles player-specific cases (lava collision, landing)
2. ✅ Uses shared GRAVITY and FALL_SPEED_MAX constants
3. ✅ `checkSupport()` works for both blocks and player

#### 6.4: Integrate GravitySystem ✅
1. ✅ Imported `GravitySystem` in `main.js`
2. ✅ Added to game components array (after terrain, before player)
3. ✅ Update order: Terrain → Gravity → Player → Rendering

**Benefits Achieved**:
- ✅ Single source of truth for gravity physics
- ✅ Easy to add gravity to new entities (enemies, items, projectiles)
- ✅ Can add variable gravity (water, moon level, power-ups)
- ✅ Centralized physics debugging
- ✅ True ECS architecture compliance

**Status**: COMPLETE - Player now uses FallableComponent for unified gravity system

### Component → System Mapping

| Component | Used By | Managed By System |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| FallableComponent | Player, Rock blocks | GravitySystem |
| PhysicsComponent | All solid blocks | Player movement, GravitySystem |
| DiggableComponent | Mud, Rock blocks | PlayerComponent |
| HealthComponent | Diggable blocks | DiggableComponent.dig() |
| LethalComponent | Lava, (future: spikes) | PlayerComponent |
| LootableComponent | Chests | DiggableComponent.dig() |
| RenderComponent | All blocks | TerrainComponent |
| DarknessComponent | Mud, Protective blocks | DarknessComponent.render() |
| ProtectiveComponent | Protective blocks | HaloGenerator |

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No files in `src/entities/` except block.entity.js
- ✅ No references to `block-registry.js` in game code
- ✅ All blocks created via BlockFactory
- ✅ Player uses FallableComponent for gravity (unified with rocks)
- ✅ LavaComponent renamed to LethalComponent
- ✅ No duplicate indicator rendering code
- ✅ Component base classes clearly distinguished (LifecycleComponent vs Component)
- ✅ All ECS component checks use `.has()` and `.get()` methods
- ✅ GravitySystem manages all falling entities
- ⚠️ Full component/system documentation - **Deferred (low priority)**

---

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Terrain still uses chunk-based generation** - Works fine, but ensure it only uses BlockFactory
2. **Shadow component** - Verify it works with ECS Block entities
3. **Navigation component** - May need audit for ECS compliance

---

## Testing Checklist (After Cleanup)

- [ ] Player falls and lands correctly
- [ ] Rocks fall and kill player on collision
- [ ] Digging works (HP reduction, destruction)
- [ ] Chests spawn and drop loot
- [ ] Protective blocks have darkness gradient
- [ ] Lava kills player
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No architectural violations

## Notes for Future Development

**When adding new block types**:
1. Create components for unique behaviors
2. Add factory method in BlockFactory
3. Use generic component names (reusable)
4. Document in COMPONENTS.md

**When adding new systems**:
1. Create in `src/systems/`
2. System should orchestrate components
3. Add to main.js in correct order
4. Document in SYSTEMS.md

**NEVER**:
- Create standalone entity classes
- Add logic to components that belongs in systems
- Use sprite-based detection (use components!)
- Access component properties directly (use methods)
